# xlr 1.0.2
- CRAN re-submission:
    - Fixed title to follows CRAN's standards
    
# xlr 1.0.1

-   CRAN re-submission. Fix issues:
    -   Made `Excel` referenced in back-ticks \`\`.
    -   Removed externally facing documentation for internal package functions.
    -   Change examples so that they no longer use `\dontrun` but instead create a temporary working directory following `readr` examples. We instead use `\dontshow` to hide setting this working directory.
    -   Fixed typos in the vignette.
    -   Fixed line spacing issues with the Description due to inconsistent space sizing.

# xlr 1.0.0
