xlr is designed to help with the analysis of survey data and
conduct modelling, and then export this information to Excel in an easy
and consistent way.

It is designed to help people with little R experience analyse survey
data quickly and easily. This includes functions to quickly analyse
multiple-response questions and block questions.

This package also provides a simple and easy to use interface with
Excel, building on the excellent work of the [openxlsx] package. It is
designed with ease of use in mind, at the expense of some functionality
of `openxlsx`.

This package relies extensively on the
[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and so we use many of the same
terms and concepts here.

There are three aspects to this package:

1.  Functions to help with the analysis of survey complex survey data.

2.  Functions to help export this data to Excel.

3.  New `R` types to support consistent formatting in Excel.

## Data: clothes_opinions

To explore how to analyse complex data we'll use the dataset
`clothes_opinions`. This dataset contains fake survey data with peoples
opinions on clothes as well as a series of demographic characteristics.
It is documented in `?clothes_opinions`.

```{r setup}
dim(clothes_opinions)
clothes_opinions
```

`clothes_opinions` is a `tibble` a adapted type of `data.frame`. You can
learn more about tibbles at
[https://tibble.tidyverse.org](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/).

It was designed to mimic data initially saved as a `.sav` file and
imported with `haven::import_spss()`. Data with this form can easily be
exported from major survey platforms such as
[Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/), and includes useful information
such as question labels which xlr functions can utilise
automatically.

## Analysing survey data

There are three main functions to analyse survey data:

-   `build_table()` which creates 1, 2, 3, ... -way tables.

-   `build_mtable()` which creates 1, 2, 3, ... -way tables for multiple
    response questions.

-   `build_qtable()` which creates 1, 2, 3, ... -way tables for a
    **block** of questions.

We will start by introducing `xlr_table()` and go through all of its
functionality. This functionality is similar for `build_mtable()` and
`build_qtable()`.

### build_table()

This function provides roughly the same functionality as base R's
`table()` except it provides a lot more support for easy use. Like all
functions in this package, we follow the convention of the first
argument is the data.frame (or tibble) that you want to work on. The
second argument are the columns we want to build a table with, and the
remainder are options for `build_table()`.

Let's first calculate the number of people of each gender in
`clothes_opinions`:

```{R}
clothes_opinions |>
  build_table(gender2)
```

You can see that we have outputted a table which shows the number of
people and the percentage of each gender in our data set.

You can easily create two or three way tables by passing additional
columns to the `cols` argument:

```{R}
clothes_opinions |> 
  build_table(c(age_group, gender2),
              table_title = "Gender by age make up of clothing opinion data")

clothes_opinions |> 
  build_table(c(age_group, gender2, Q1_1),
              table_title = "Responses to Q1_1 by age and gender")
```

The `cols` argument uses **tidy selections** to select the columns we
want to make a table with. See
[\<tidy-select\>](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/dplyr_tidy_select.html)
for more details on the selectors. This should be familiar for people
who use dplyr verbs.

The data returns has a **long format** by default. Currently wide table
table is unsupported but may be included in a future update.

#### Introduction to xlr_table()

You can also see that it has a special type `xlr_table()`. This is a S3
class defined by xlr to help output the data to Excel. It contains
the table data, a table title and a footnote, as well as hidden data to
help format the table in Excel. You can learn more about `xlr_table()`
in the vignette `to do`.

You can directly pass a title and a footnote to `build_table()` by
passing them as arguments to `build_table()`:

```{R}
clothes_opinions |>
  build_table(gender2,
              table_title = "Gender make up of clothing opinion data",
              footnote = "This shows that the data has a representative sample.")
```

#### Labels in xlr

Now if you were paying close attention, you may have noticed that
`clothes_opinions$gender2` went from being `haven_labelled` to a
`xlr_vector()`. A `xlr_vector` is a wrapper around other types (see
below for more details), and the base type is `character()`. All
`build_*` functions will convert this data automatically, as well as
pull information on the labels. See `haven`'s documentation for more
details about the labelled type:
<https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/labelled.html>.

Additionally, if your data is labelled, you can pull out the question
label metadata automatically and include it in the footnote by
specifying `use_questions = TRUE`. Columns that don't have a label are
ignored.

```{R}
clothes_opinions |>
  build_table(c(age_group, gender2),
              table_title = "Gender by age make up of clothing opinion data",
              use_question = TRUE)
```

#### Weights

Weights are supported, you only need to pass the column name for the
weights to the `wt` argument:

```{R}
clothes_opinions |>
  build_table(c(age_group, gender2),
              table_title = "Gender by age make up of clothing opinion data (weighted)",
              wt = weight)
```

#### Missing data

`build_table()` uses only complete cases by default, that is for one of
the columns we are if a row includes a single `NA` it is removed from
the table calculation. To include `NA` values set `use_NA = TRUE`. This
will mean that **ALL** `NA`'s will be included in the calculation of the
table:

```{R}
clothes_opinions |>
  build_table(c(group, age_group),
              table_title = "Survey group by age make up of clothing opinion data",
              use_NA = TRUE)
```

If you would like to include the `NA` values of only one or some of the
columns we recommend using `dplyr::filter()` as demonstrated below.

```{R}
clothes_opinions |>
  # remove all the rows where group is missing
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(group)) |>
  # by setting use_NA to true we keep the NA's from the age_group column
  build_table(c(group, age_group),
              table_title = "Survey group by age make up of clothing opinion data",
              use_NA = TRUE)
```

### build_mtable()

This function is design to analyse multiple response questions in survey
data. To do so the data must be **wide data** with *one* response per
column (and the remaining responses NA). This is how Qualtrics exports
this data by default. The format is shown below:

```{R}
clothes_opinions |>
  dplyr::select(starts_with("Q2"))
```

To create a table using the `mcol` argument to specify the mutliple
response columns you would like to create a table with:

```{R}
clothes_opinions |>
  build_mtable("Q2")
```

The output `N` count is the number of people that responded to each
multiple response option, the `N_group` is the total number of people
that responded to this question. The `Percent` is the percentage of
people that responded to each of the options. As you can respond to
multiple options this percentage will likely not add up to 100.

Note, internally `build_mtable()` uses `tidyselect::starts_with()` to
select the columns that you would like to build a table with, because of
this you need to pass a string to `mcol`.

You can cut your multiple response column by other data by passing
columns to the `cols` argument. As with `build_table()` it uses
`<tidy-eval>` to select the columns.

```{R}
clothes_opinions |>
  build_mtable(mcol = "Q2",
               cols = age_group)
```

The `N_group` for this question is the number of people in each age
group that responded to the multiple response question.

It is common that a mulitple response column will include an *other*
response in a survey. This column needs to be removed *before* you
analyse the data with `build_mtable()`. We recommend using
`dplyr::select` as demonstrated below:

```{R}
clothes_opinions |>
  dplyr::select(-Q3_other) |>
  build_mtable(mcol = "Q3",
               cols = age_group)
```

As above you can see the `build_mtable()` automatically converts haven
labelled data to a `xlr_vector()`.

#### Multiple multiple response columns

You can pass up to **two** multiple response columns to
`build_mtable()`, any more and we recommend filtering before hand.

```{R}
clothes_opinions |>
  dplyr::select(-Q3_other) |>
  build_mtable(mcol = c("Q2","Q3"))
```

The `N_group` is the number of people in each age_group that responded
to one of the options in age_group. `N` is the number of people that
responded to the multiple response question in each group.

### build_qtable()

This function is designed to help analyse a block of questions. A block
of questions is where all the responses use the same scale (it is
usually a matrix question). The data should have the form:

```{R}
clothes_opinions |>
  dplyr::select(starts_with("Q1"))
```

To analyse a question block, you need to pass a `<tidy-eval>` selection to the
function to select all columns in the question block. See we pass the same statement
we made in the select statement above.

```{R}
clothes_opinions |>
  build_qtable(starts_with("Q1"))

# You can also select the columns directly
clothes_opinions |>
  build_qtable(c(Q1_1,Q1_2,Q1_3,Q1_4))
```


You can cut all the columns in the question block by another column(s)
by specifying the `cols` argument. As with `build_table()` it uses
`<tidy-eval>` to select the columns.

```{R}
clothes_opinions |>
  build_qtable(starts_with("Q1"),
               gender2)
```

## xlr_table(), xlr types and writing to Excel

A key part of the xlr is to export data to Excel in an easy, and
user friendly way. The workhorse function in this scenario is
`xlr_table()`, and if you like the default options is meant to be the
function that you will mostly use.

A `xlr_table()` is a `tibble::tibble()` with an optional title, and
footnote, as well as a number of formatting options.

```{R}
clothes_opinions |>
  xlr_table("This is a title",
             "this is a footnote with extra information")
```

When you call `xlr_table()` it converts the elements of your table to
different `xlr` types.

### Types

xlr types are defined to help with the formatting of columns when
they are output to Excel. There are four difference types defined in
xlr:

-   `xlr_numeric()` to format doubles neatly.

-   `xlr_integer()` to format integer data neatly.

-   `xlr_percent()` to format numeric data as a percentage.

-   `xlr_vector()` a general type to format data nicely without
    specific rules.

All of the above variables contain the argument `xlr_format` which only
takes a `xlr_format()` object. `xlr_format()` allows you to control
different formatting options when the data is outputted to Excel, it
currently does not change how the data looks in console. You can change
the font size, colour, text position etc. with `xlr_format()`. See
`?xlr_format` for the full range of options.

For `xlr_numeric()` and `xlr_percent()` you can also set the number of
decimal places through setting `dp=x`.

### Updating/Formatting columns

You can update the format of individual columns by using `dplyr::mutate`
or base R by setting the column with new formatting options:

```{R}
table <- xlr_table(mtcars, "A clever title", "A useful footnote")
             
# Lets update the format of the mpg column so that it displays using 0 decimal places
table$mpg <- xlr_numeric(table$mpg, dp = 0)

# You can also use mutate to achieve the same thing, this is useful for
# updating multiple columns either by using across or in a single statement
table <- table |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    mpg = xlr_numeric(mpg, dp = 0),
    # convert columns that are integers to xlr_integer type
    across(vs:carb, ~ xlr_integer(.x))
  )
```

### dplyr verbs

The `xlr_table()` type is implemented to work with most `dplyr` verbs
to make working with the data as seamless as possible. To find out more
see `?xlr_and_dplyr`.

## Writing data to Excel

xlr makes writing data to Excel easy using the `write_xlsx()`
function. This function takes either a `xlr_table`, `tibble` or
`data.frame`. Note when you output a single object you need to specify

```{R}
write_xlsx(mtcars,
           file = "example.xlsx",
           sheet_name = "example_sheet")
```

The output looks like this in Excel:

![Example of exporting a data.frame with write_xlsx, it shows a simple
table in Excel.](img/data.frame_example.png)

When you output a `xlr_table` with this function additional formatting
will be applied to the data as well as the title and a footnote.

```{R}
write_xlsx(table,
           file = "example.xlsx",
           sheet_name = "example_sheet")
```

The output looks like this in Excel:

![Example of using a xlr_table with write_xlsx, the table now has a
table, footnote and formatting!](img/xlr_table_example.png)

To update this formatting you either need to update the styles of the
columns using the above, or if you want to modify the style of the table
use `update_theme`. You can modify the the format of the title,
footnote, column heading or table body. The below example shows how to
update title colour to be red and the underlined:

```{R}
table <- update_theme(table,
                      title_format = xlr_format(font_colour = "red",
                                                 text_style = "underline"))
write_xlsx(table,
           file = "example.xlsx",
           sheet_name = "example_sheet")
```

The output looks like this:

![Example of update theme in use, the title is red and
underlined](img/update_theme_example.png)

See `?update_theme` for more details.

### `write_xlsx()` and `list()`

Like `openxlsx::write.xlsx()` you can also pass a **named list** to `write_xlsx()`
and these will be automatically created as sheets in the Excel file.  If you have
a `list()` of tables, set `TOC = TRUE` in order to generate a
table of contents for the Excel file. This is particularly useful when you have
a large number of tables.

# Putting it all together

Example of how you can use xlr to analyse a survey is below:

```{R}
output_list <- list()

output_list[["gender"]] <- build_table(clothes_opinions,
                                       gender2,
                                       "Gender in clothes opinions survey")


output_list[["gender age"]] <- build_table(clothes_opinions,
                                       c(gender2, age_group),
                                       "Gender by age in clothes opinions survey")

output_list[["gender age"]] <- build_table(clothes_opinions,
                                       c(gender2, age_group),
                                       "Gender by age in clothes opinions survey")

output_list[["opinions"]] <- build_qtable(clothes_opinions,
                                        starts_with("Q1"),
                                       table_title = "Opinions on different clothing items")

# Sometimes it is neater to use the pipe operator on the data
# This also allows auto completion in RStudio for variable names
output_list[["opinions gender"]] <- 
  clothes_opinions |>
    build_qtable(starts_with("Q1"),
                  gender2,
                 table_title = "Opinions on different clothing items by gender2",
                 use_questions = TRUE)

# now output the data, we turn on the option to generate a table of contents
write_xlsx(output_list,
           file = "example2.xlsx",
           TOC = TRUE)
```

```{r, include = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# delete the example files if they exist already
if (file.exists("example.xlsx")) file.remove("example.xlsx")
if (file.exists("example2.xlsx")) file.remove("example2.xlsx")
```
