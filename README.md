# xlr

xlr is designed to help build summary tables with complex survey data,
and export data to Excel. It includes functions to easily make
cross-tabulations, work with multiple response data, and question
blocks. It supports labelled data that can be generated from the popular
survey platform Qualtrics.

It makes exporting data from Excel easier. It is a easier to use wrapper
around [openxlsx](https://ycphs.github.io/openxlsx/). It supports tables
with footnotes, headers, and generating table of contents in Excel
documents. It is not fully featured, but designed to be used when you
are moving either statistical summaries or tables from R into Excel.

This package is designed to work seamlessly with
[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) family of functions.

It is currently experimental and subject to change based on peoples
feedback.

## Installation

You can install the development version of xlr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("NHilder/xlr")
```

## Example

This is a example of how to create a two-way table, fix the formatting
for that table, and then export that table to Excel.

``` r
library(xlr)
library(dplyr)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'dplyr'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     filter, lag
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

# create a summary table
two_way_table <- build_table(mtcars,c(cyl,gear))
two_way_table
#> # A xlr_table: 8 x 4
#>       cyl    gear       N Percent
#>   <x_dbl> <x_dbl> <x_int> <x_pct>
#> 1    4.00    3.00       1      9%
#> 2    4.00    4.00       8     73%
#> 3    4.00    5.00       2     18%
#> 4    6.00    3.00       2     29%
#> 5    6.00    4.00       4     57%
#> 6    6.00    5.00       1     14%
#> 7    8.00    3.00      12     86%
#> 8    8.00    5.00       2     14%

# make the percentage have two decimal places using dplyr
two_way_table <- two_way_table |> 
  mutate(Percent = xlr_percent(Percent, dp = 2))

# write the data to an xlsx file
write_xlsx(two_way_table,
           "example.xlsx",
           "an example")
```
